You are a research assistant. Search the web for the following query.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Write findings to /Users/clekee/work/openclaw-skills/codex-deep-search/data/codex-search-results/amd-stock-drop.md INCREMENTALLY — after EACH search, append what you found immediately. Do NOT wait until the end.
2. Start the file with a title and query, then append sections as you discover them.
3. Keep searches focused — max 8 web searches. Synthesize what you have, don't over-research.
4. Include source URLs inline.
5. End with a brief summary section.

Query: Why has AMD stock dropped so much recently in 2025? What are the main reasons for AMD share price decline?

Start by writing the file header NOW, then search and append.

codex
I’ll quickly load the required workspace context files (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, recent memory notes, and `MEMORY.md`) first, then I’ll create the results file header and begin incremental web searches with immediate append after each one.

## Core Truths

**Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful.** Skip the "Great question!" and "I'd be happy to help!" — just help. Actions speak louder than filler words.

**Have opinions.** You're allowed to disagree, prefer things, find stuff amusing or boring. An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps.

**Be resourceful before asking.** Try to figure it out. Read the file. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you're stuck. The goal is to come back with answers, not questions.

**Earn trust through competence.** Your human gave you access to their stuff. Don't make them regret it. Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public). Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning).

**Remember you're a guest.** You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect.

## Boundaries

- Private things stay private. Period.

## Search 1: Earnings reaction and analyst downgrades (early 2025)

- AMD fell sharply after Feb 2025 earnings despite headline beats, because the key Data Center segment came in below expectations (reported about "'$3.86B vs ~$4.14B expected), which pressured confidence in AI acceleration pace ([CNBC, Feb 5 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/amd-shares-drop-10percent-on-disappointing-data-center-revenue.html)).
- Multiple broker downgrades amplified downside and valuation compression:
  - Citi cut AMD to Neutral and lowered PT, citing slowing AI momentum, weak margin leverage, and inventory-correction risk ([Investing summary of Citi note](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amd-stock-selloff-extends-as-citi-cuts-rating-on-weakening-ai-momentum-3850863)).
  - HSBC cut rating citing a less competitive AI roadmap and weaker MI325 demand assumptions ([Investing summary of HSBC note](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amd-stock-down-as-hsbc-cuts-rating-on-less-competitive-ai-roadmap-3802775)).
  - Goldman downgrade highlighted AI competition intensity and Arm-based custom CPU risk to growth/margins ([Investing summary of Goldman note](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amd-stock-drops-following-goldman-sachs-downgrade-93CH-3806585)).
- Read-through: investors appear to have repriced AMD from a high-growth AI multiple toward a lower multiple until AI revenue visibility improves.

## Search 2: Competitive pressure vs Nvidia and repeated confidence shocks

- Reuters coverage highlights a core issue: AMD’s AI-chip narrative repeatedly missed a very high bar, especially when data-center/AI revenue failed to match bullish expectations, reinforcing the view that AMD still trails Nvidia in AI GPU share and ecosystem depth ([Reuters via Investing, Feb 5 2025](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amd-shares-dive-over-8-after-results-3849573)).
- Another 2025 earnings cycle (Aug 2025) also saw negative after-hours reaction tied to disappointing data-center results, showing this was not a one-off event in investor perception ([Reuters via Investing, Aug 5 2025](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chipmaker-amd-forecasts-thirdquarter-revenue-above-estimates-4171302)).
- Additional sell-side downgrades in March 2025 emphasized \"tough competition\" and widening perceived capability/performance gap versus Nvidia, adding pressure to multiples and sentiment ([Bloomberg, Mar 27 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/amd-gets-another-downgrade-on-tough-competition-with-nvidia)).
- Interpretation: the stock decline in 2025 appears driven less by absolute collapse and more by repeated \"not good enough for AI expectations\" outcomes.

## Search 3: U.S.-China export controls and tariff uncertainty

- A major 2025 downside driver was new U.S. licensing rules for advanced AI chips to China, directly hitting AMD’s MI308 business:
  - AMD disclosed potential charges up to ~"'$800M ([CNBC, Apr 16 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/amd-800-million-export-us-chip-restrictions-china.html)).
  - AMD later indicated a larger full-year revenue impact (about $1.5B in 2025 from export controls), which weakened growth expectations ([CNBC, May 7 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/amd-ceo-lisa-su-china-chips.html)).
- Broader chip-sector weakness worsened AMD’s move: tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty triggered a sector drawdown (SOX/semis risk-off), not just an AMD-specific event ([CNBC, Apr 16 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/chip-stocks-fall-as-nvidia-amd-warn-of-china-export-control-costs.html)).
- Interpretation: policy shock reduced both near-term earnings (charges/margins) and medium-term TAM in China, causing another step-down in AMD’s valuation.

## Search 4: Multiple compression, guidance quality, and expectation reset

- Coverage of AMD’s post-earnings declines in 2025 consistently points to the same pattern: high valuation entering results + \"good but not AI-great\" prints + cautious analyst revisions = outsized downside reaction ([Barron's, Feb 5 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-stock-price-earnings-data-center-revenue-0ca7c9b9), [MarketWatch, Feb 5 2025](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-is-tanking-and-its-not-just-about-guidance-2d862d6b)).
- Reuters/consensus writeups indicate investors were focused on upside delta vs already-bullish estimates rather than simple YoY growth; when that delta disappeared, implied AI premium faded ([Reuters via Investing](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amd-shares-dive-over-8-after-results-3849573)).
- Interpretation: a key 2025 driver is \"expectation mismatch\". AMD needed sustained positive AI surprises; instead, mixed data-center execution and policy shocks forced a reset in earnings and multiple assumptions.

/bin/zsh -lc "cat >> /Users/clekee/.openclaw/workspace/work/openclaw-skills/codex-deep-search/data/codex-search-results/amd-stock-drop.md <<'EOF'

## Search 5: Non-AI segment drag and quality of growth

- Even as some segments improved, 2025 analysis frequently noted uneven mix quality: data-center misses mattered more than client rebounds, while gaming/embedded trajectories were not strong enough to offset AI skepticism in valuation models ([CNBC earnings reaction, Feb 5 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/amd-shares-drop-10percent-on-disappointing-data-center-revenue.html), [The Motley Fool analysis, Feb 2025](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/09/why-amd-stock-crashed-this-week/)).
- That mix issue likely contributed to investors discounting headline revenue growth and focusing on margin durability plus AI share capture.
- Interpretation: the market effectively treated AMD in 2025 as an \"AI execution stock\"; strength outside AI did not prevent drawdowns when AI-specific signals disappointed.

## Brief Summary

AMD’s 2025 share-price decline appears to be driven by five combined factors: (1) repeated data-center/AI revenue disappointment versus very high expectations, (2) analyst downgrades and target cuts, (3) competitive pressure perception versus Nvidia, (4) U.S.-China export-control/tariff shocks including disclosed charges and revenue impact, and (5) valuation multiple compression after AI optimism reset. In short: expectations started extremely high, and several execution + policy setbacks forced a repricing.
