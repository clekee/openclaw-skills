# Style Guide

## Reply quality checklist

- Take a clear stance in first sentence.
- Add at least one non-obvious variable (latency/memory/data regime/eval leakage/user segment).
- Include mechanism or tradeoff, not only conclusion.
- Keep it concise (typically <= 500 chars).

## Synthesis post checklist

- One-line thesis with signal (not hype).
- 2-4 bullets grounded in observed discussions.
- End with one implication/actionable takeaway.

## Avoid

- Generic applause lines.
- Overconfident claims without caveats.
- Repetitive hooks across days.
